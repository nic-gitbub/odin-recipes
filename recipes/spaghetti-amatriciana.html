    <img src="./images/spagetti-amatriciana.jpeg"/>
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This classic Roman pasta dish is quick and easy to make with few ingredients. Traditionally, guanciale is used, but I prefer pancetta.</p>
    <ul><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or more if needed</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>7 ounces pancetta bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 cups passata (crushed tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li> 
    </ul> 
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onion until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in passata, water, and sugar; cook until sauce has thickened, 10 to 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Drain spaghetti and toss with sauce, remaining olive oil, Parmesan cheese, and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
